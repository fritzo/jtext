jtext
-----

JText is a markup language and typesetter for math written in ascii art,
targeting latex and html (via jtext2latex and jtext2html, resp).
One of the coolest features is compiling ascii-art sequent rules to latex.

jtext2latex was used to typeset Fritz Obermeyer's
[http://fritzo.org/thesis PhD thesis], which is part of the [http://github.com/fritzo/Johann Johann] theorem prover project.
There are lots of examples of .jtext markup in Johann's [https://github.com/fritzo/Johann/tree/master/scripts scripts] directory.
